# Nonequilibrium Field Theories and Stochastic Dynamics

Welcome to the English preview of the lecture notes for *Nonequilibrium Field Theories and Stochastic Dynamics* (Erwin Frey, LMU Munich, 2025).

This site mirrors the Chinese master notes while we gradually translate the material. At the moment only the course introduction is available in English; the remaining lectures reuse the Chinese originals until translations are ready.

## Navigation

- Use the language switcher in the header to swap between Chinese and English.
- The **Lecture Notes** section lists every lecture. Entries without an English translation fall back to the Chinese source.
- Mathematical expressions are rendered with MathJax. If a formula fails to display, reload the page and report the issue.

## Contributing

Please refer to `TERMS.yml` for the shared terminology glossary and `翻译要求.md` for translation conventions. Pull requests are welcome—remember to include the lecture number in filenames (`NN.Topic.md`) so the ordering stays synchronized with the course.
